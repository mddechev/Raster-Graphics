The project documentation must include:

Task analysis and your approach to the solution (how you broke down the solution into steps, what method or algorithm you chose, how you handled specific problems).

A brief description of the classes created to solve the task (the chosen architecture, description of the member data and member functions of the classes, and how they are used).

Ideas for future improvements.
